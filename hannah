i don't remember what we discussed in the morning debrief!
oh wait the nine tapping points that was really cool and exactly what we needed to bring down our stress.
here is a bit of my scrum writing thing for canvas
Why should your company use the Scrum methodology? 
The scrum methodology is built to handle change. In adapting it for this workplace, youâ€™ll find that this project management methodology (which is a form of Agile) is ready to react quickly and with ease to any changes that need to be made to a project.
It is ideal for teams, with self-organizing teams being the core of Scrum. Teams in this methodology rely on clearly defined roles, motivated individuals, and regular collaboration.
This communication and collaboration leads us to having a Daily Scrum, a short meeting in which the small teams get into the habit of communicating, problem solving, identifying struggles and ultimately generating ideas together.
